# ðŸ§  Data Structures Homework (C++)

Welcome to my C++ Data Structures homework repository! This project contains multiple assignments completed for my Data Structures course, each showcasing core CS concepts like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and recursion â€” all implemented in C++.

# ðŸ§ª How to Run the Code

To compile and run any `.cpp` file, use a C++ compiler like `g++`:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

# ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

Dynamic memory and pointers

Singly & doubly linked lists

Stack & queue implementations

Recursion

Binary trees & traversal

Sorting & searching algorithms

# ðŸ“Ž Notes

This repository is for educational purposes only. If you're a student, feel free to explore and learn â€” but please don't submit this code as your own. That would be lame ðŸ˜….
